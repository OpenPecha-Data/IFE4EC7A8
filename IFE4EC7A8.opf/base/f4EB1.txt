2. Praise of perfect wisdomTherefore then, Ananda, Bodhisattvas who want to dwell in the highest dwelling, who want to dw
ell in the dwelling of the Tathagata, should dwell in the dwelling of perfect wisdom.And with any Bodhisattva who course
s in perfect wisdom one can be quite certain that he had, before he was reborn here among men, deceased among menor amon
g the heavenly hosts of the Tushitas.For it is among men and the Tushita Gods that this perfection of wisdom circulates 
in its full extent.One can be certain that the Tathagatas behold those Bodhisattvas who course in this perfection of wis
dom, who learn it, bear it in mind, study, preach, repeat, or merely write it, and who also instruct the other Bodhisatt
vas, admonish, instigate and encourage them.One should know that they have planted wholesome roots with the Tathagatas.T
hey have not only in the presence of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas planted wholesome roots so as to train in perfect wis
dom, but, without any doubt, those Bodhisattvas who train in this perfection of wisdom and remain unafraid, they have pl
anted wholesome roots with the Tathagatas.(460) Those who take up this perfection of wisdom, bear it in mind, study, pre
ach, repeat and write it, who pursue it, -its meaning, contents and method â€“ one should be quite certain that they have 
been face to face with Tathagatas.If Bodhisattvas do not revile this perfection of wisdom, do not oppose, deny or reject
it, then one should know that they have fulfilled their duties under the Jinas of the past.

But if a Bodhisattva does not go back on his vow to win full enlightenment, then he does not give the wholesome root, whi
ch he has planted in the presence of the Tathagatas, over to Discipleship or Pratyekabuddhahood as his reward.And as a r
ule such Bodhisattvas are grateful and practise the perfection of wisdom.
