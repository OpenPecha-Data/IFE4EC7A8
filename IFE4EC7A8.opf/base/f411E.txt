8. Prediction about spread of perfect wisdomMoreover, these Sutras associated with the six perfections will, after the pa
ssing away of the Tathagata, appear in the South. From the South they will spread to the East, and from there to the Nor
th- from the time when the Dharma-Vinaya is like freshly made cream right into the period when the good law disappears.T
hose who at that time study and preserve this perfection of wisdom will be brought to mind by the Tathagata; the Tathaga
ta will know,sustainand see them,and behold them with his Buddha-eye.

Sariputra: Will even this so deep perfection of wisdom in the last time, in the last period, be widespread in the norther
n direction, in the northern part of the world? The Lord: Those who, in the North, will make efforts in this deep perfec
tion of wisdom after they have heard it, (226) they will make it widespread.As set out for long in the vehicle should th
e Bodhisattvas be known who will study this perfection of wisdom then.
