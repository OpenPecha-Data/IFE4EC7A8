3. Nothing to take hold ofSubhuti: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom.Certainly as a great enterprise it has been set up.The
Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For all-knowledge has been entrusted to it, and so has the level of a Pratyekabuddha and the le
vel of all the Disciples.An anointed king, a Kshatriya, who feels strong and secure in his kingdom, entrusts all his bus
iness concerning his kingly office, and the city and the kingdom to his minister,and he himself has few cares and his bu
rden is light.Just so, whatever dharmas of Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, or Disciples there may be, they are all entrusted t
o the perfection of wisdom.It is the perfection of wisdom which in them does the work.It is in this manner that perfect 
wisdom has set up for a great enterprise, i.e. so that one should not take hold of form, etc., nor settle down in it.And
as for the skandhas,so also for the fruits of the holy life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to the state of all-knowl
edge.

Subhuti: In what way has perfect wisdom been set up so that one should not take hold of the state of all-knowledge, nor s
ettle down in it? (282) The Lord: Do you view Arhatship as a real dharma which you could take hold of, or settle down in
? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.I also do not view Tathagatahood as real,and therefore I do not take hol
d of it, do not settle down in it.For that reason all-knowledge also is a state in which one neither takes hold of anyth
ing, nor settles down in anything.Subhuti: Bodhisattvas who have but newly set out in the vehicle, and whose wholesome r
oots are but small, must beware that they do not tremble when they hear this exposition.On the other hand, Bodhisattvas 
will, on hearing this deep perfection of wisdom, firmly believe in it if they are suitable for Buddhahood, have fulfille
d their duties under the Jinas of the past, and have planted wholesome roots for a long time.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti
