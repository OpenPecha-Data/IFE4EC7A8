2. The cult of perfect wisdom compared with the cult of the buddhasSakra: Suppose that there are two persons. One of the 
two, a son or daughter of good family, has written down this perfection of wisdom, made a copy of it; he would then put 
it up, and would honour, revere, worship, and adore it with heavenly flowers, incense, perfumes, wreaths, unguents, arom
atic powders, strips of cloth, parasols, banners, bells, flags, with rows of lamps all round, and with manifold kinds of
worship. The other would deposit in Stupas the relics of the Tathagata who has gone to Parinirvana; he would take hold 
of them and preserve them; he would honor, worship and adore them with heavenly flowers, incense, etc., as before. Which
one of the two, O Lord, would beget the greater merit? The Lord: I will question you on this point,and you may answer t
o the best of your abilities.The Tathagata, when he had acquired and known full enlightenment or all-knowledge, in which
practices did he train the all-knowledge-personality which he had brought forth? (58) Sakra: It is because the Lord has
trained himself in just this perfection of wisdom that the Tathagata has acquired and known full enlightenment or all-k
nowledge.The Lord: Therefore the Tathagata does not derive his name from the fact that he has acquired this physical per
sonality,but from the fact that he has acquired all-knowledge.And this all-knowledge of the Tathagata has come forth fro
m the perfection of wisdom.The physical personality of the Tathagata, on the other hand, is the result of the skill in m
eans of the perfection of wisdom.And that becomes a sure foundation for the [acquisition of the] cognition of the all-kn
owing [by others]. Supported by this foundation the revelation of the cognition of the all-knowing takes place, the reve
lation of the Buddha-body, of the Dharma-body, of the Samgha-body.The acquisition of the physical personality is thus th
e cause of the cognition of the all-knowing. As the sure foundation of that cognition it has, for all beings, become a t
rue shrine, worthy of being saluted respectfully, of being honoured, revered and adored.After I have gone to Parinirvana
, my relics also will be worshipped.It is for this reason that the person who would copy and worship the perfection of w
isdom would beget the greater merit.For, in doing so, he would worship the cognition of the all-knowing. (59) The son or
daughter of good family who has made a copy of the perfection of wisdom, and who worships it, would beget the greater m
erit.For by worshipping the perfection of wisdom he worships the cognition of the all-knowing.

Sakra: How can it be that those men of Jambudvipa, who do not copy this perfection of wisdom, nor take it up, nor study i
t, nor worship it, do not know that the Lord has taught that the cult of the perfection of wisdom is greatly profitable!
How is it that they are not aware that the Lord has taught that the cult of the perfection of wisdom brings great advan
tages, fruits and rewards! But they do not know this, they are not aware of this! They have no faith in it! The Lord: Wh
at do you think, Kausika, how many of those men of Jambudvipa are endowed with perfect faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, 
the Samgha? (60) Sakra: Only a few.The Lord: So it is, Kausika.Only a few men of Jambudvipa are endowed with perfect fai
th in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Samgha.Fewer than those few are those who attain the fruits of a Streamwinner, and,
after that, the fruit of a Once-Returner, or of a Never-Returner.Fewer still are those who attain Arhatship.Fewer still
realise Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment.Fewer still raise their thoughts to full enlightenment.Fewer still are those who, 
having raised their thoughts to full enlightenment, strengthen that thought.Fewer still those who, having raised their t
houghts to full enlightenment, and strengthened that thought, in addition dwell with vigor exerted.Fewer still those who
pursue meditation on the perfection of wisdom.Fewer still those who course in the perfection of wisdom.Fewer still thos
e who, coursing and striving in the perfection of wisdom, abide on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage.Fewer still, cours
ing and striving in the perfection of wisdom, will know full enlightenment.Fewer still, coursing and striving in the per
fection of wisdom, do know full enlightenment.Now, those Bodhisattvas who have stood on the irreversible Bodhisattva-sta
ge, and who have known full enlightenment, they expound the perfection of wisdom to other sons and daughters of good fam
ily (61) who are earnestly intent, who train themselves, and strive, in the perfection of wisdom.And they, in their turn
, take up the perfection of wisdom, studyand worship it.There are, on the other hand, countless beings who raise their t
houghts to enlightenment, who strengthen that thought of enlightenment, who course towards enlightenment,- and perhaps j
ust one or two of them can abide on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage!For full enlightenment is hard to come up to if o
ne has inferior vigour, is slothful, an inferior being, has inferior thoughts, notions, intentions and wisdom.So then, i
f someone wants quickly to know full enlightenment, he should indefatigably and continually hear and study this very per
fection of wisdom.For he will understand that in the past, when he was a Bodhisattva, the Tathagata trained in the perfe
ction of wisdom;that also he should train in it;that she is his Teacher.In any case, when the Tathagata has disappeared 
into final Nirvana, the Bodhisattvas should run back to this very perfection of wisdom.(62) Therefore then, Kausika, if 
someone would build, for the worship of the Tathagata who has disappeared into final Nirvana, many kotis of Stupas made 
of the seven precious things, enshrining therein the relics of the Tathagata,and all his life honor them with flowers, e
tc., would he then, on the strength of that, beget a great deal of merit? Sakra: He would, O Lord.The Lord: Greater woul
d be the merit of someone who would truly believe in this perfection of wisdom; who would, trustingly, confiding in it, 
resolutely intent on it, serene in his faith, his thoughts raised to enlightenment, in earnest intent, hear it, learn it
, bear it in mind, recite and study it, spread, demonstrate, explain, expound and repeat it, illuminate it in detail to 
others, uncover its meaning, investigate it with his mind; who, using his wisdom the fullest extent, would thoroughly ex
amine it; who would copy it, and preserve and store away the copy â€“ so that the good dharma might last long, so that the
guide of the Buddhas might not be annihilated, so that the good dharma might not disappear,so that the Bodhisattvas, th
e great beings might continue to be assisted, since their guide will not give out,- and who, finally, would honour and w
orship this perfection of wisdom. (63) Greater would be the merit of the devotee of the perfection of wisdomcompared not
only with that of a person who would build many kotis of Stupas made of the seven precious things, enshrining the relic
s of the Tathagata. It would be greater than the merit of one who would completely fill the entire Jambudvipa with such 
Stupas.(64) It would be greater than the merit produced by all beings in a four-continent world system if each single on
e of them were to build such a Stupa.(65) Or, equally, if all beings in a small chiliocosm,(66) or in a medium dichilioc
osm,(67) or in a great trichiliocosm would do likewise.(68) Or, if, to put an imaginary case, all beings in a great tric
hiliocosm should simultaneously become human beings, and each one of them build such a Stupa; and if each one of them sh
ould build all those Stupas, and honor them for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon;(69) still the devotee of the perfec
tion of wisdom would have greater merit than that which results from the effect of the meritorious deeds of all those be
ings who erect and worship those countless Stupas.

Sakra: So it is, O Lord.For the person who honours the perfection of wisdom, in an absolute sense he honours the past, fu
ture and present Buddhas in all the world systems, which can be comprehended only by the cognition of a Buddha.His merit
will be greater even than that of all beings in great trichiliocosms countless like the sands of the Ganges, (70) if ea
ch single being in them would build a Stupa, and if each one of them would build all those Stupas, and honor them for an
aeon or the remainder of an aeon.
