2. The earth shakes, and many are savedWhen this disquisition of the Suchness of the Tathagata had taken place, the great
earth shook in six ways, stirred, quaked, was agitated, resounded and tumbled, as it did when the Tathagata won full en
lightenment.Subhuti: It is thus, O Gods, that Subhuti the Elder is born after the image of the Tathagata.

But he is not born after the image of form, or of any of the fruits of a holy life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to B
uddhahood.For those dharmas, which might be born after the image of something, or in the image of which he would be born
, they do not exist, they are not got at.It is thus that Subhuti the Elder is born in the image of the Tathagata.

Sariputra: This Suchness, O Lord, courses in the deep!The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.But when this disquisition of Suchnes
s was expounded, the minds of three hundred monks were freed from the outflows, without any further clinging. Five hundr
ed nuns obtained the pure, dispassionate and unstained dharma-eye. (310) Five thousand Gods, who in the past had made th
e necessary preparations, acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced. And the minds of six tho
usand Bodhisattvas were free from the outflows, without any further clinging.
