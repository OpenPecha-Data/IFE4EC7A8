6. Obstacles to perfect wisdomSubhuti: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom.It is a heap of treasure.It is a pure heap, as pur
e as space.It would not be surprising if many obstacles should arise to someone who takes up, etc., this perfection of w
isdom.(221) The Lord: There will be many obstacles to the study of this perfection of wisdom.For Mara, the Evil One, wil
l make great efforts to cause difficulties.Therefore one should hurry up with oneâ€™s task of copying it out. If one has o
ne month to do it in, or two months, or three months, one should just carry on with the writing.If one has a year or mor
e, even then one should just carry on with writing this perfection of wisdom [since after, or even during, that time one
may be prevented by all kinds of interruptions].Because it is a fact that in respect of very precious things many diffi
culties are wont to arise.

Subhuti: Here, O Lord, when the perfection of wisdom is being studied, Mara, the Evil One, will in many ways show zeal, a
nd exert himself to cause difficulties.The Lord: In spite of that (222) he is powerless to cause really effective obstac
les to a Bodhisattva who gives his undivided attention to his task.
