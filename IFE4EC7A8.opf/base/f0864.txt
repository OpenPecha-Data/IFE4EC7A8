2. Rewards of perfect wisdomAnd the four Great Kings, the World Guardians, will come to the Bodhisattva who trains in thi
s way in the perfection of wisdom, and they will say to him: “Train yourself quickly in this course of a Bodhisattva, so
n of good family! Nimbly train yourself!Here are the four begging bowls which you shall receive when you are seated on t
he terrace of enlightenment, as one who then has won full enlightenment.”Not only the four World Guardians will come to 
the Bodhisattva who trains in perfect wisdom as it has been expounded, but I also, not to mention the other Gods.Constan
tly also the Tathagatas will bring him to mind.All the worldly ills that might befall the Bodhisattva who courses in per
fect wisdom, such as attacks from others, etc., shall be prevented from affecting him in any way.This also, O Lord, is a
quality which a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom gains in this very life.

Ananda thereupon thought: Is this speech of Sakra, Chief of Gods, due to his own insight, or to the Buddha’s might? Sakra
, through the Buddha’s might, read his thoughts, and said: To the Buddha’s might, Ananda, to the Buddha’s sustaining pow
er should this be attributed. For I myself (415) am quite incapable of uttering anything relevant on the subject of Bodh
isattvas.The Lord: So it is, Ananda.What Sakra, Chief of Gods, has said was due to the Tathagata’s might, to his sustain
ing power.
