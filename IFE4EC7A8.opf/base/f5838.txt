5. Misdirection of aimMoreover, when people write, or teach the perfection of wisdom, or train in it, someone will come a
long and disparage life in the hells, in the animal world, among the Pretas and Asuras, saying “so ill are all these for
ms of life, so ill are all conditioned things;do make an end to just this ill, and leave those beings to their fate.”Thi
s also is a work of Mara.

(246) Or again, someone may come along and praise life among the Gods: “So happy are the Gods, so happy is life in the he
avens. One should therefore tend sense-desires in the world of sense-desires, enter into the well-known trances in the w
orld of form, and enter into the well-known attainments in the formless world.”Considered by wisdom all this is, however
, nothing but rebirth in suffering.Because the Lord has said: “I do not praise any kind of rebirth in becoming, because 
it lasts no longer than a finger-snap.For everything that is conditioned is impermanent. Anything that may cause fear is
ill. All that is in the triple world is empty. All dharmas are without self.When the wise have understood that all this
is thus devoid of eternity, impermanent, ill, doomed to reversal, then just here they should attain the fruits of the h
oly life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to Arhatship.Let them beware of meeting any further with those attainments, w
hich are really failures, and which abound in suffering.”But nevertheless, to some Bodhisattvas this will be a source of
anxiety [because they will feel deterred from the quest for full enlightenment by a desire for rebirth among the Gods].
This also Mara does to them.
