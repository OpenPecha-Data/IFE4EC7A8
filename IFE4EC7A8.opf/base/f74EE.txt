1. Sakra praises the bodhisattvasThereupon it occurred to Sakra, Chief of Gods: A Bodhisattva, even if he courses only ju
st so far, surpasses all; how much more so when he has known full enlightenment!A great gain has accrued to those beings
, a good life do they live when their thought strides in all-knowledge;how much more so when they have raised their thou
ght to full enlightenment!To be envied are those beings, the very cream of all beings, who will know full enlightenment!

Thereupon Sakra, Chief of Gods, conjured up Mandarava flowers, saluted them reverently, scattered them over the Tathagata
, and said: May those persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, and who have raised their thoughts to full 
enlightenment, succeed in their resolve to know full enlightenment, and, after that, to transfer all beings who are born
e along by the great flood of birth-and-death to the smooth yonder shore! May that thought of enlightenment which they h
ave wished for, thought over and taken hold of, bring to fulfilment in them the dharmas of a Buddha, the dharmas associa
ted with all-knowledge, the dharmas of the Self-Existent, the insuperable dharmas!I have not even the slightest suspicio
n that those Bodhisattvas, who are endowed with the great compassion, might turn away from full enlightenment,(435) or t
hat those persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and who have set out for full enlightenment might turn a
way from it.On the contrary, I am sure that this resolve to win full enlightenment will increase more and more in them, 
as they survey the ills which afflict beings on the plane of birth-and-death.For through their great compassion they des
ire the welfare of the world with its Gods, men and Asuras, desire to benefit it, are full of pity for it, they, who are
endowed with this attitude of mind, dwell in the attitude of mind which is expressed in their resolution that “we have 
crossed over, we shall help beings to cross over! Freed we shall free them! Recovered we shall help them to recover! Gon
e to Nirvana we shall lead them to Nirvana!”
