3. MeritWhen he stands, trains, progresses, meditates and strives as it is ordained, described and explained in this perf
ection of wisdom, he gets rid also of those faults which cause him to turn away from full enlightenment.(344) If now one
Bodhisattva gives himself up to devotion to perfect wisdom, and does deeds for one day only while dwelling completely i
n mental activities connected with perfect wisdom;and if another Bodhisattva lacks in perfect wisdom, but gives gifts fo
r countless aeons; superior to him is the Bodhisattva who, for one day only, makes endeavours about perfect wisdom.

A Bodhisattva who for one day only makes endeavours about perfect wisdom begets greater merit than another Bodhisattva wh
o for countless aeons gives and bestows gifts on all the classes of holy persons, - from Streamwinners to Tathagatas - b
ut lacks in perfect wisdom.

If that other Bodhisattva should not only bestow gifts as indicated, but in addition observe the moral precepts, but lack
in perfect wisdom,then this Bodhisattva, a dweller in perfect wisdom, would beget the greater merit if, after he had em
erged from his mental work on perfect wisdom, he would demonstrate dharma.

And that would remain true (345) even if the other Bodhisattva in addition were endowed with patience.

Even if in addition he would exert vigour, would make endeavours about the trances and wings of enlightenment, but were s
till lacking in perfect wisdom;a Bodhisattva who, after he had given the gift of dharma, as said before, would turn it o
ver to full enlightenment, would beget a merit greater than his.

Greater still would be the merit of a Bodhisattva who not only gave the gift of dharma, not only turned it over into full
enlightenment,

but employed the kind of turning over which has been taught in the perfection of wisdom.But if a Bodhisattva, after he ha
s done all that, makes no further efforts about it in meditative seclusion, (346) then his merit is less than that of on
e who also makes efforts about it in meditative seclusion and who, taken hold of by perfect wisdom, causes that meditati
ve seclusion to be not devoid of perfect wisdom. The latter begets the greater merit.
