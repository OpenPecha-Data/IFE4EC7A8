1. Prediction of AvakirnakusumaThereupon, at that time, one of the Gods of the Thirty-three seized Mandarava flowers, mag
nificent Mandarava flowers, and came to where the Lord was.And just at that time, six thousand monks were assembled and 
seated in that assembly.They rose from their seats, put their upper robes over one shoulder, placed their right knees on
the earth, and saluted the Lord with their folded hands.Through the Buddha’s might their hands were then filled with Ma
ndarava flowers, with magnificent Mandarava flowers.They scattered those flowers over the Lord, and said: “We, O Lord, s
hall course in this perfection of wisdom! We, O Lord, shall dwell in the supreme dwelling of perfect wisdom!”

Thereupon, on that occasion, the Lord smiled.But such is the nature of the Buddhas and Lords that, when they manifest a s
mile [in an assembly of Bodhisattvas], then various-coloured rays issue from the Lord’s mouth, - rays blue, yellow, red,
white, crimson, crystal, silverfish and golden.These rays illuminate endless and boundless world systems with their lus
tre, they rise right up to the world of Brahma, again return from there to the Lord, circulate thrice round the Lord, an
d then vanish again in the head of the Lord.

(458) Thereupon the venerable Ananda rose from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on t
he earth, bent his folded hands towards the Lord, and said: It is not without reason that the Tathagatas manifest a smil
e.What is the reason for your smile, O Lord? The Lord: Those six thousand monks, Ananda, shall in a future period, in th
e Starlike aeon, know full enlightenment, and after that demonstrate dharma to beings.They all shall bear the same name.
With Avakirnakusuma for their namethese Tathagatas shall be teachers in the world.They shall all have an equal congrega
tion of disciples.They shall all live the same length of time, i.e. twenty thousand aeons.Each one of them shall have an
extensive holy writ, that shall spread widely among Gods and men.In each case their good law shall abide for the same l
ength of time, for twenty thousand aeons.And showers of flowers, of all the five colours, shall descend on all of them -
wherever they may leave the home which they had in village, town or marketplace, wherever they may turn the wheel of dh
arma, wherever they may dwell, wherever they may appear [among people]. (459,1)
