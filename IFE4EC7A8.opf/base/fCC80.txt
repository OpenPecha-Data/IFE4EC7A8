5. Training in perfect wisdomThen the thought came to Sakra, Chief of Gods: Profoundly wise, surely, is the Holy Subhuti,
in that he explains this merely nominal existence [of all separate things], does not bring it into conflict [with the no
rm of truth], but enlarges on it and simply expounds it.He then said to the Venerable Subhuti: So it is.The Bodhisattva 
should so train himself therein [in this insight] as the Holy Subhuti points out.Subhuti: So he should.When he thus trai
n himself,he does not train himself in the fruit of a Streamwinner, nor in the other fruits of the holy life, up to Budd
hahood.When one trains oneself on those stages, one trains oneself in Buddhahood,or the state of all-knowledge; and ther
eby in the immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-dharmas.Thereby one trains oneself neither for the increase of form, fee
ling, etc., nor yet for their decrease;(43) neither to appropriate form, etc., nor to let them go.Nor does one train one
self to get hold of any other dharma, even of all-knowledge, nor to produce one, or make one disappear.When he trains th
us, a Bodhisattva trains in all-knowledge, and he shall go forth to all-knowledge.

Sakra: Will a Bodhisattva go forth to all-knowledge, even though he does not train himself to get hold of any dharma, - e
ven of all-knowledge, - nor to produce one, or make one disappear?

Subhuti: He will.

(44) Sakra then said to Sariputra: Where should a Bodhisattva search for perfect wisdom? Sariputra: In the exposition of 
the Venerable Subhuti.Sakra: Through whose might, and on whose authority, does the Holy Subhuti teach perfect wisdom? Sa
riputra: Through the Tathagata’s might, and on his authority.Subhuti: It is indeed the Tathagata’s might, Sakra, by whic
h I teach perfect wisdom.And when you ask, ‘Where should a Bodhisattva search for perfect wisdom?’, the answer is: He sh
ould not search for it in form, nor in any other skandha; nor in what which is other than form, or other than any other 
skandha.Because perfect wisdom is not one of the skandhas, nor yet other than they. (45,1)
