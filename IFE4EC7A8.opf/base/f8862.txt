2. The range of jubilationSubhuti: A Bodhisattva, a great being, considers the world with its ten directions, in every di
rection, extending everywhere. He considers the world systems, quite immeasurable, quite beyond reckoning, quite measure
less, quite inconceivable, infinite and boundless. He considers in the past period, in each single direction, in each si
ngle world system, the Tathagatas, quite immeasurable, quite beyond reckoning, quite measureless, quite inconceivable, i
nfinite and boundless, who have won final Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind, - (136) their tra
cks cut off, their course cut off, their obstacles annulled, guides through [the world of] becoming, their tears dried u
p, with all their impediments crushed, their own burdens laid down, with their own weal reached, in whom the fetters of 
becoming are extinguished, whose thoughts are well freed by right understanding, and who have attained to the highest pe
rfection in the control of their entire hearts.He considers them, from where they began with the production of the thoug
ht of enlightenment, proceeding to the time when they won full enlightenment, until they finally entered Nirvana in the 
realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind, and the whole span of time up to the vanishing of the good Dharma [as prea
ched by each one of these Tathagatas]. He considers the mass of morality, the mass of concentration, the mass of wisdom,
the mass of emancipation, the mass of the vision and cognition of emancipation of those Buddhas and Lords.In addition h
e considers the store of merit associated with the six perfections, with the achievement of the qualities of a Buddha, a
nd with the perfections of self-confidence and of the powers; and also those associated with the perfection of the super
knowledges, of comprehension, of the vows; and the store of merit associated with the accomplishment of the cognition of
the all-knowing, with the solicitude for beings, the great friendliness and the great compassion, and the immeasurable 
and incalculable Buddha-qualities.And he also considers the full enlightenment and its happiness, and the perfection of 
the sovereignty over all dharmas, and the accomplishment of the measureless and unconquered supreme wonderworking power 
which has conquered all, and the power of the Tathagata’s cognition of what is truly real, which is without covering, at
tachment or obstruction, unequalled, equal to the unequalled, incomparable, without measure, and the power of the Buddha
-cognition preeminent among the powers, and the vision and cognition of a Buddha, the perfection of the ten powers, the 
obtainment of that supreme ease which results from the four grounds of self-confidence, (137) and the obtainment of Dhar
ma through the realization of the ultimate reality of all dharmas.He also considers the turning of the wheel of Dharma, 
the carrying of the torch of Dharma, the beating of the drum of Dharma, the filling up of the conch shell of Dharma, the
wielding of the sword of Dharma, the pouring down of the rain of Dharma, and the refreshment of all beings through the 
gift of Dharma, through its presentation to them.He further considers the store of merit of all those who are educated a
nd trained by those demonstrations of Dharma, - whether they concern the dharmas of Buddhas, or those of Pratyekabuddhas
, or of Disciples, - who believe in them, who are fixed on them, who are bound to end up in full enlightenment.He also c
onsiders the store of merit, associated with the six perfections, of all those Bodhisattvas of whom those Buddhas and Lo
rds have predicted full enlightenment. He considers the store of merit of all those persons who belong to the Pratyekabu
ddha vehicle, and of whom the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha has been predicted. He considers the meritorious work fo
unded on giving, morality and meditational development, of the four assemblies of those Buddhas and Lords, i.e. of the m
onks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen. He considers the roots of good planted during all that time by Gods, Nagas, Yaks
has, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras and Mahoragas, by men and ghosts, and also by animals, at the time when those
Buddhas and Lords demonstrated the Dharma, and when they entered Pairinirvana, and when they had entered Parinirvana (1
38) – thanks to the Buddha, the Lord, thanks to the Dharma, thanks to the Samgha, and thanks to persons of right mind-cu
lture.[In his meditation the Bodhisattva] piles up the roots of good of all those, all that quantity of merit without ex
ception or remainder, rolls it into one lump, weighs it, and rejoices over it with the most excellent and sublime jubila
tion, the highest and utmost jubilation, with none above it, unequalled, equalling the unequalled.Having thus rejoiced, 
he utters the remark: “I turn over into full enlightenment the meritorious work founded on jubilation. May it feed the f
ull enlightenment [of myself and of all beings]!”
