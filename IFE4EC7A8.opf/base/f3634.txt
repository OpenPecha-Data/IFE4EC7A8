1. The superior position of bodhisattvasAt that time Sakra, Chief of Gods, was seated amid that assembly,and said: To be 
sure, deep is this perfection of wisdom,hard to see, hard to understand!The Lord: So it is, Kausika.With the depth of sp
ace is this perfect wisdom deep.As isolated it is hard to see,as empty it is hard to understand.Sakra: Those beings who 
hear this perfection of wisdom, take it up, study, spread, and write it, must be endowed with more than a puny wholesome
root!The Lord: So it is.If all the beings in Jambudvipa were endowed (411) with [the ability to observe] the ten ways o
f wholesome action, would they on the strength of that beget much merit? Sakra: They would, O Lord.The Lord: A person wh
o hears, studies, spreads and writes this perfection of wisdom begets greater merit than they.The just mentioned heap of
merit, due to the morality of all beings in Jambudvipa, is infinitesimal compared with the heap of merit which is due t
o the wholesome root of someone who hears, studies, spreads and writes this deep perfection of wisdom.

Thereupon a monk said to Sakra, Chief of Gods: You have been surpassed, Kausika, by that person who hears, studies, sprea
ds and writes this deep perfection of wisdom!Sakra: I am even surpassed by that son or daughter of good family who has r
aised but one single thought to enlightenment:(412) how much more so if in addition they train in Thusness, progress to 
it, make endeavours about it;on their journey they surpass the whole world with its Gods, men and Asuras.On their journe
y they not only surpass the world with its Gods, men and Asuras, but also all the Streamwinners, Once-Returners, Never-R
eturners, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas.They surpass also those Bodhisattvas who are great almsgivers but lack in perfect w
isdom and skill in means;and equally those whose morality is perfectly pure, who possess a vast quantity of morality, wh
ose observation of the moral rules is unbroken, flawless, unstained, complete, perfectly pure and unspotted, but who lac
k in perfect wisdom and skill in means;and equally those who have won patience and peaceful calm, (413) whose thoughts a
re free from hostility, who feel no thought of malice even when burned at the stake, but who lack in perfect wisdom and 
skill in meansand equally those who have exerted vigour, who persist in trying, who are free from sloth, and remain unco
wed in all they do with body, voice and mind, but who lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means;and equally those who ar
e fond of the trances and delight in them, who are strong and powerful in the trances, who are established in the trance
s, who are masters of the trances, but who lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means.For, when he courses in the perfect
ion of wisdom as it has been expounded, a Bodhisattva surpasses the world with its Gods, men and Asuras, surpasses all t
hose who belong to the vehicle of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, surpasses also the Bodhisattvas who are not skilled
in means. And they cannot surpass him.For a Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of wisdom as it has been expounde
d, who complies with it, has taken up his position so that the lineage of the all-knowing should not be interrupted,and 
he does not keep aloof from the Tathagatas.His journey will, when he progresses in this way, shortly bring him to the te
rrace of enlightenment;(414) he will, training himself in this way, rescue the beings who have sunk into the mud of the 
defilements.Training himself in this way, he trains in the training of a Bodhisattva, and not in the training of a Disci
ple or Pratyekabuddha.
