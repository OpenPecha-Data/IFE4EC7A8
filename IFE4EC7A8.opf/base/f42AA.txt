Chapter XXIX Approaches

Furthermore, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should approach the perfection of wisdom as follows: Through non-attachment to all dh
armas.From the non-differentiatedness of all dharmas.From the fact that all dharmas cannot possibly come about.In the co
nviction that “all dharmas are equal in remaining unaffected by change.”Because he has recognized by wisdom that all dha
rmas, as without self, give us no hint [about their true nature or intentions].In the conviction that “all talk about dh
armas [is extraneous to them], consists in mere words, mere conventional expression,”– but the conventional expression d
oes not refer to anything real, it is not derived from anything real, nor is itself anything real.In the conviction that
“all dharmas lie outside conventional expression and discourse, that it is not they that have been conventionally expre
ssed or uttered.”From the unlimitedness of all dharmas.From the unlimitedness of form, etc.,from the signlessness of all
dharmas.(476) By penetration into all dharmas.From the fact that all dharmas are perfectly pure in their original natur
e.From the fact that all dharmas are beyond words.Because all the different kinds of forsaking are really equal [in valu
e and kind], since all dharmas have never been stopped.Because Suchness is everywhere the same, since all dharmas have a
lready attained Nirvana.In the conviction that “all dharmas do not come, nor do they go; they cannot be generated, they 
are unborn, their non-birth being absolute.”Because he observes neither himself nor others.In the conviction that “all d
harmas are holy Arhats, perfectly pure in their original nature.”In the conviction that “all dharmas have put down their
burden, because no burden had ever been put on them.”From the fact that all dharmas have neither place nor locality.For
form, etc., is without place and locality, in accordance with the own-being of its original nature.Because he is exhila
rated by the cessation of all dharmas.Because he feels neither content nor discontent.Because he becomes neither impassi
oned nor dispassionate.For form, etc., in their true reality, in their own-being, do not become either impassioned or di
spassioned.In the conviction that “the original nature [of all dharmas], is perfectly pure.”In the conviction that, “all
dharmas are non-attached, free from both attachment and non-attachment.” (477,1)In the conviction that “all dharmas are
essentially enlightenment, because they are all equally understood by the Buddha-cognition.”From the emptiness, Signles
sness and Wishlessness of all dharmas.In the conviction that “all dharmas are essentially a healing medicine, because th
ey are controlled by friendliness.”In the conviction that “all dharmas are dwellers in friendliness, dwellers in compass
ion, dwellers in sympathetic joy, dwellers in impartiality.”In the conviction that “all dharmas are identified with the 
supreme universal spirit, because in their being no faults can arise, because in their essential being all faults remain
unproduced.”In the conviction that “all dharmas are equally neither hopeful nor hostile.”One should approach the boundl
essness of the perfection of wisdom through [the analogy of] the boundlessness of the ocean;through [the analogy of] the
multicoloured brilliance of Meru.One should approach the boundlessness of the perfection of wisdom: from the boundlessn
ess of form, etc.;through the [analogy of] boundless illumination shed by the circle of the sun’s rays;from the boundles
sness of all sounds;from the boundlessness of the final achievement of all the dharmas of a Buddha;from the boundlessnes
s [of the excellence] of the equipment of the whole world of beings with merit and cognition;from the boundlessness of t
he element of earth;and so from the boundlessness of the elements of water, fire, air, space and consciousness.(478) One
should approach the unlimitedness of the perfection of wisdom from the unlimitedness of the collection of wholesome and
unwholesome dharmas;from the unlimitedness of the collection of all dharmas.One should approach the boundlessness of th
e perfection of wisdom: through the acquisition of the boundlessness of the concentration on all dharmas;from the boundl
essness of all Buddha-dharmas;from the boundlessness of all dharmas;from the boundlessness of emptiness;from the boundle
ssness of thought and its constituents;from the boundlessness of thoughts and actions.One should approach the measureles
sness of the perfection of wisdom from the measurelessness of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas.One should approach the 
resounding declarations of the perfection of wisdom through the [analogy of the] roaring of the lion’s roar.One should a
pproach the fact that the perfection of wisdom cannot be shaken by outside factors from the fact that all dharmas cannot
be shaken by outside factors.For form, etc., is like the ocean.Form, and each skandha, is like the firmament;like the b
rilliant and multicoloured Meru;like the production of the rays of the disk of the sun;boundless like all sounds;boundle
ss like the whole world of beings;boundless like the final achievement of the dharmas of a Buddha;boundless like the equ
ipment with merit and cognition of all beings in the world;(479) it is like the earth,like water,fire,air,spaceand consc
iousness;it has no definite boundary like the collection of all wholesome and unwholesome dharmas;it has no definite bou
ndary like the collection of all dharmas.Form is the departure [into Buddhahood], the own-being of form is the Buddha-dh
armas which are essentially the Suchness of form; etc., to: consciousness is departure [into Buddhahood], the own-being 
of consciousness is the Buddha-dharmas which are essentially the Suchness of consciousness.Form, and each skandha, is th
e boundless true nature of all dharmas;the empty, boundless true nature [of things];the boundlessness of thought and its
constituents;it gives rise to thoughts and actions;it is wholesome or unwholesome until there is non-apprehension;it is
like the lion’s roar;it cannot be shaken by outside factors.In such ways should a Bodhisattva approach perfect wisdom.

(480) If the Bodhisattva approaches perfect wisdom in this way, apperceives it, enters into it, understands it, reflects 
on it, examines, investigates, and develops it, - with acts of mind that have abandoned all deception and deceit, all co
nceit, the exaltation of self, all laziness, the deprecation of others, the notion of self, the notion of a being, gain,
honour and fame, the five hindrances, envy and meanness, and all vacillation, - then it will not be hard for him to gai
n the full perfection of all virtues, of the Buddha-field and of the supreme dharmas of a Buddha.
