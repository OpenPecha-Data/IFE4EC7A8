2. Predominance of perfect wisdom over the other perfectionsHow should a Bodhisattva stand in the perfection of wisdom, h
ow attend and pay homage to it? The Lord: In every way the perfection of wisdom should be treated like the Teacher himse
lf.

Sakra then asked Sariputra: Wherefrom, and for what reason has this question of the holy Sariputra arisen? (172) Sariputr
a: It arose because I heard it said that “a Bodhisattva who, taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means, t
ransform into all-knowledge the meritorious work founded on jubilation, surpasses the entire meritorious work founded on
giving, morality, patience, vigour, and trance of all the Bodhisattvas who observe a basis.”It is just the perfection o
f wisdom which directs the five perfection in their ascent on the path to all-knowledge.Just as, Kausika, people born bl
ind, one hundred, or one thousand, or one hundred thousand of them, cannot, without a leader, go along a path and get to
a village, town or city; just so, Giving, Morality, Patience, Vigour and Trance cannot by themselves be called ‘perfect
ions,’for without the perfection of wisdom they are as if born blind, without their leaderunable to ascend the path to a
ll-knowledge,and still less can they reach all-knowledge. When, however, Giving, Morality, Patience, Vigour and Trance a
re taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom, then they are termed ‘perfections,’for then (173) these five perfections a
cquire an organ of vision which allows them to ascend the path to all-knowledge, and to reach all-knowledge.
