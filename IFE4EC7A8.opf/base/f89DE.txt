2. Description of Gandhavati, and of Dharmodgata’s lifeWhen Sadaprarudita thus sorrowed and pined away, a Tathagata-frame
[suddenly] stood before him, gave his approval and said: Well spoken, son of good family!For the Tathagatas of the past
, when they were Bodhisattvas, have also searched for perfect wisdom in the same spirit in which you just now search for
it.In this same spirit of vigour and determination, of zeal and zest, - do you go East!There, five hundred leagues away
from here, is a town called Gandhavati. It is built of the seven precious things. It is twelve leagues long and twelve 
leagues broad, and enclosed by seven walls, seven moats and seven rows of palm trees. It is prosperous and flourishing, 
secure from attack, contains abundant provisions and is full of beasts and men. Five hundred rows of shops run through t
he town from one end to the other, beautiful to behold like a well-coloured painting, arranged one by one in regular suc
cession, and in between them well-constructed sites and passages are erected, respectively for vehicles drawn by animals
, for palanquins, and for pedestrians, so that there is plenty of room for all.The walls all round that town are made of
the seven precious substances.(486) Their well-founded copings slope into the golden river Jambu.And on each coping gro
ws a tree, made of the seven precious things, laden with various fruits, also made of precious things. All around, betwe
en each tree and the next, hangs a string, also made of precious substances.A network of small bells in fastened on the 
strings,and thus surrounds the entire city.When stirred by the wind, the small bells give out a sweet, charming and deli
ghtful sound,just like the sound from the five musical instruments when they are played in harmony by the Gandharvas, sk
illed in songs.And that sound causes those beings to divert, enjoy and amuse themselves.The moats all around the city ar
e full of water which flows gently along, neither too cold nor too hot.The boats on that river are brilliant with the se
ven precious things, beautiful to behold, and their existence is a reward of the past deeds of the inhabitants who, aboa
rd them, divert, enjoy and amuse themselves.The water is everywhere covered with blossoms of the blue lotus, of the pink
lotus, of the white lotus, and with other most beautiful and fragrant flowers.There is no species of flowers in the gre
at trichiliocosm that is not found there.All around that city there are five hundred parks,beautiful to behold, brillian
t with the seven precious things.(487) Each park has five times five hundred large lotus ponds,covered with beautiful bl
ossoms,each of the size of a cartwheel, fragrant, - blue, yellow, red and white.The sounds of geese, cranes, ducks, curl
ews and other birds fill the air over the ponds.And the existence of those parks which they do not regard as their own p
rivate property is a reward for the past deeds of those beings, for they had coursed for a long time in the perfection o
f wisdom, their minds faithfully devoted to the Guide of the Buddhas and bent on listening to her and understanding her,
and for a long time they had been intent on deep dharmas.And there, in that city of Gandhavati, at a place where four r
oads meet, is the house of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, - one league all round,bright with the seven precious things, be
autiful to behold,enclosed by seven walls and seven rows of palm trees.There are four parks near the house, for the enjo
yment of those who live in it.They are called Nityapramudita,Asoka, Sokavigata, and Pushpacitra.Each park has eight lotu
s ponds, called Bhadra, Bhadrottama, Nandi, Nandottama, Kshama, Kshamottama, Niyata and Avivaha.One side of each pond is
of gold, the second of silver, (488) the third of vaidurya, the fourth of crystal.The ground at the bottom consists of 
quartz, with golden sand over it.Each pond has eight stairs to it, decorated with steps, made of variegated jewels.In th
e gaps between the steps, inside the golden river Jambu, grows a plantain tree.The ponds are covered with various kinds 
of water flowers, and the air above them is filled with the sounds of various birds.Round these ponds grow various flowe
ring trees,and when they are stirred by the wind, their flowers drop into the ponds.The water in the ponds has the scent
, colour, taste and feel of sandalwood.In this mansion lives the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, with his retinue, among them s
ixty-eight thousand women. He diverts, enjoys and amuses himself, he feels and tastes the five kinds of sense-pleasure.A
ll the inhabitants of that city, both women and men, divert, enjoy and amuse themselves, they have constant joy in the p
arks and on the ponds and they feel and taste the five kinds of sense-pleasure.The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, however, wit
h his retinue, diverts, enjoys and amuses himself only for a certain time, and thereafter he always demonstrates the per
fection of wisdom.And the citizens of that town built a pulpit for the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata in the central square of 
the town. It has a golden base, then a cotton mattress is spread on that, then a woollen cover, a cushion and a silken c
loth are put on top of that.High up in the air, half a Kos high, there is an awning, shining with pearls, even and firm.
All (489) round that pulpit flowers of the five colours are strewed and scattered, and the pulpit itself is scented with
various perfumes.So pure is the heart of Dharmodgata, so great the respect of his hearers for dharma.Seated on that pul
pit the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrates the perfection of wisdom.The citizens of that town listen to his teaching w
ith great respect for dharma, with trust in dharma, with faith in what is worthy of faith, with minds that are lifted up
in faith.In addition many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of living beings, Gods and men, assemble
there to listen.Some of them explain the perfection of wisdom, some repeat it, some copy it, some follow it with wise a
ttention.All those beings are no longer doomed to fall into the states of woe, and they are irreversible from full enlig
htenment.Son of good family, go to that Bodhisattva Dharmodgata!From him you shall hear the perfection of wisdom.For he 
has been for a long time your good friend, he has summoned, instigated and encouraged you to win full enlightenment.He a
lso has, in the past, searched for the perfection of wisdom in the same way in which just now you search for it.Go forth
, son of good family, go on day and night, giving your undivided attention to the task! Before long you shall hear the p
erfection of wisdom!

When the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita had heard this, he became contented, elated, joyful, overjoyed and jubilant.(490) A ma
n, hit with a poisoned arrow, could not think of anything else except: “Where shall I find a surgeon, a skilled physicia
n, who can pull out this arrow, and free me from this suffering.”Just so the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita at that time pays
no attention to any dharma except: ”When then shall I see that son of good family from whom I shall hear the perfection
of wisdom? When I have heard that dharma, I shall forsake all attentions to a basis.”

Without leaving the place where he was Sadaprarudita then heard the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrating the perfection 
of wisdom.
