3. Faults in connection with detachmentFurthermore, Mara the Evil One may come to the Bodhisattva and exhort and inform h
imin connection with the quality of detachment that the Tathagata has praised detachment, and that that means that one s
hould dwell in the remote forest, in a jungle, in mountain clefts, burial grounds, or on heaps of straw, etc.But that is
not what I teach as the detachment of a Bodhisattva, that he should live in a forest, remote, lonely and isolated, or i
n jungle, mountain clefts, burial grounds, on heaps of straw, etc.

Subhuti: If that is not the detachment of the Bodhisattva, what then is it? The Lord: A Bodhisattva dwells detached when 
he becomes detached from the mental activities associated with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas (392,1).For, if he is t
aken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means, and if he dwells in the dwelling of friendliness and of great c
ompassion towards all beings, then he dwells detached even when he dwells in the neighborhood of a village.It is I who h
ave ordained this detachment from the mental activities associated with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.A Bodhisattva 
dwells detached if he passes day and night dwelling in this detachment.If a Bodhisattva dwells in this dwelling while he
lives in remote dwelling places, in the remote forest, in the jungle, in mountain clefts or burial grounds, then he dwe
lls detached.But as to the detachment recommended by Mara, the Evil One, - i.e. the dwelling in remote forests, jungles,
mountain clefts and burial grounds, - if that detachment is actually contaminated by the mental activities associated w
ith Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, then, as he does not practise the perfection of wisdom, he does not fulfil the condit
ions necessary to win all-knowledge.He dwells in a contaminated dwelling, in a mental activity which is not quite pure, 
and in consequence his deeds of body, voice and mind cannot be quite pure.In consequence of that he despises other Bodhi
sattvas who dwell in villages, but who are uncontaminated by mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabud
dhas, who dwell in the dwelling of wisdom with its many devices, and with its great compassion.Since his deeds of body, 
voice and mind are not quite pure, he is just a dweller in contamination, not a dweller in detachment, although he may d
well in the remote forest.At first he despises those who live in the neighborhood of a village, though they dwell in the
dwelling of wisdom, with its devices and great compassion, though they are habitually quite pure in what they do with t
heir body, voice or mind, though they are detached from mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,
uncontaminated by them (393,1); after that he finds that the cannot gain the Trances, Concentrations, Attainments, Eman
cipations and Super-knowledges,and that they do not reach their fulfilment in him.The reason is that he is without skill
in means.

Even though a Bodhisattva may dwell in deserted forests hundreds of miles wide, with no other company than beasts of prey
, antelopes, flocks of birds, uninfested even by the smaller wild animals, by Yakshas and Rakshasas, and untroubled by t
he fear of robbers, and even though he may settle there for one year, or for one hundred years, or even for hundreds of 
thousands of niyutas of kotis of years, or for more than that;- if he does not know the detachment which I have explaine
d, and through which a Bodhisattva dwells as one who has set out with earnest intention, who has achieved earnest intent
ion;then even one completely devoted to life in the remote forest fails to gladden my heart, if he does not know this [d
etachment], if he is without skill in means,if he leans of that detachment of his, clings to it, is bent on it, indulges
in it.For the detachment of a Bodhisattva which I have described does not appear in his detachment.But from a place hig
h up in the air Mara will say to the dweller in the remote forest that he does well, that his detachment is the one whic
h the Tathagata has described,that he should go on dwelling in just this detachment,and that in consequence of it he wil
l quickly win full enlightenment.(394) When he leaves that isolated place in the forest, and comes back to a village, he
despises the Bodhisattvas there, monks who are well behaved, chaste, lovely in character, uncontaminated by mental acti
vities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, and living lives quite pure, in body, voice and mind.He tells them
that they surely do not dwell in a detached dwelling, but in a contaminated and crowded one.Those Bodhisattvas there, w
ho dwell in a detached dwelling, he warns against contaminated and crowded dwellings.He tries to commit them to a detach
ed dwelling [as he conceives it].He claims their respect for his isolated residence, he becomes proud,and tells them: “S
uperhuman beings have exhorted me, superhuman beings have come to inform me!This [isolated place in the forest], Subhuti
, is the dwelling in which I dwell.What dweller in a village has ever been exhorted and informed by superhuman beings?” 
In this kind of way he despises the persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattva.He should be known as a Candala
of a Bodhisattva, as a defamer of Bodhisattvas, as a mere fake of a Bodhisattva, as a counterfeit Bodhisattva, as filth
of a Bodhisattva, as a robber in the guise of a Shramana, a robber of persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisatt
vas, a robber of the world with its Gods.Such a one should surely not be tended, loved or honoured.For such persons have
fallen into conceit.(395) They will even succeed in corrupting other kindred spirits, weaklings who have but recently s
et out in the vehicle.They should be regarded as impure by nature,as devoid of proper teachers,devoid of the qualities o
f holiness.But a Bodhisattva should not tend such persons, nor love or honour them, if he is one who has neither abandon
ed all beings, nor all-knowledge, nor full enlightenment, if he wants earnestly to win full enlightenment, and to bring 
about the weal of all beings.On the contrary, one who has raised himself to a height where he considers the weal of all 
beings, should, so that he may see through these and other deeds of Mara, always have a mind which is anxious to expound
the path to beings who have not yet got it, a mind which does not tremble and which is not submerged in the wanderings 
through the triple world;he has first of all an attitude of friendliness, and an attitude of compassion, he has produced
the great compassion and is moved by pity, he has a thought of joy in sympathy with the beings who progress in the righ
t direction, he is impartial because the true nature of dharmas is such that it cannot be apprehended; [with all this in
mind] he should form the resolution: “Thus will I act that in future all the faults of Mara’s deeds shall in no way wha
tsoever either be, or be produced;or, if produced, that they shall at once pass away again. Thus will I train myself!”Th
is should also be known as a Bodhisattva’s courageous advance towards his own higher knowledge.So much for what a Bodhis
attva should know about Mara’s deeds in connection with the quality of detachment.
