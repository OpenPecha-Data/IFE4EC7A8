5. No growth or diminutionSubhuti: Can something have growth, or diminution, if it is beyond all distinctive words? The L
ord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: But if there is no growth or diminution of an entity which is beyond all distinctive words, th
en there can be no growth or diminution of the six perfections.And how then could a Bodhisattva win full enlightenment t
hrough the force of these six perfections, if they do not grow, and how could he come close to full enlightenment, since
, without fulfilling the perfections, he cannot come close to full enlightenment?(349) The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.There
is certainly no growth or diminution of a perfection-entity.A Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, who develops p
erfect wisdom, and who is skilled in means, does obviously not think that “this perfection of giving grows, this perfect
ion of giving diminishes.”But he knows that “this perfection of giving is a mere word.”When he gives a gift he turns ove
r to full enlightenment the mental activities, the productions of thought, the roots of good which are involved in that 
act of giving.But he turns them over in such a way that he respects the actual reality of full enlightenment.

And he proceeds in the same way when he takes upon himself the moral obligations,

when he perfects himself in patience,

(350) when he exerts vigour,

enters into the trances,

courses in perfect wisdom, develops perfect wisdom.

Subhuti: What then is this supreme enlightenment? (351) The Lord: It is Suchness.But Suchness neither grows nor diminishe
s.A Bodhisattva who repeatedly and often dwells in mental activities connected with that Suchness comes near to the supr
eme enlightenment, and he does not lose those mental activities again.It is certain that there can be no growth or dimin
ution of an entity which is beyond all words,and that therefore neither the perfections,nor all dharmas, can grow or dim
inish.It is thus that, when he dwells in mental activities of this kind, a Bodhisattva becomes one who is near to perfec
t enlightenment.
