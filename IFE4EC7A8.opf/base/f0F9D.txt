2. Qualifications of a bodhisattva who obtains perfect wisdomSariputra: In front of an irreversible Bodhisattva, of a Bod
hisattva predestined to enlightenment, should the deep perfection of wisdom be taught.For he will not hesitate, not doub
t, not be stupefied, not dispute it.

(213) Sakra: What would be the fault in teaching this perfection of wisdom in front of an unpredestined Bodhisattva?Sarip
utra: If Kausika, unpredestined, a Bodhisattva obtains this perfection of wisdom, for vision, praise, worship and hearin
g, and if he remains unafraid when he hears it, one can be sure that he has come from afar, has set out for long in the 
vehicle, and that his wholesome roots are well matured.It will not be long from now onwards until he receives the predic
tion to supreme enlightenment.One can be sure that that prediction will be near,and will come to him before he has passe
d by one, two or three Tathagatas.And, of course, he will please the Tathagatas whom he passes by, will please them perm
anently,and he will see to it that the vision of those Tathagatas will bear the fruit of the prediction, that it will le
ad him to the prediction to supreme enlightenment [itself].

Come from afar, O Lord,set out for long in the great vehicle,with wholesome roots well matured is that Bodhisattva who ob
tains this perfection of wisdom for vision, praise, worship and hearing.How much more so if he would not only hear it, b
ut also take it up, (214) bear it in mind, preach, study, spread, explain and repeat it.

The Lord: So it is, Sariputra, as you have said.
