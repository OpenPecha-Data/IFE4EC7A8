1. Conditioned coproductionSubhuti: If a Bodhisattva wins full enlightenment, is that due to the production of the first 
thought of enlightenment, or due to the last thought of enlightenment? Those two acts of thought can nowhere be synthesi
zed [and therefore they cannot cooperate in producing a result].How can an accumulation of a Bodhisattvaâ€™s wholesome roo
ts take place? The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, is the wick of a burning oil lamp burned up by the first incidence 
of the flame, or by the last incidence of the flame? Subhuti: Not so, O Lord!It is not burned up by the first incidence 
of the flame,nor independent of it,and it is also not burned up by the incidence of the last flame, nor independent of i
t.The Lord: Has then this wick been definitely burn up? Subhuti: Yes, Lord.The Lord: In the same way, it is neither thro
ugh the first nor through the last thought of enlightenment, nor independent of them (353) that a Bodhisattva wins full 
enlightenment.He does not win it through these productions of thought, nor otherwise than through them.And yet he does w
in full enlightenment.
