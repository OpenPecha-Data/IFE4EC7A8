1. The good friendsA Bodhisattva who has set out with earnest intention and wants to win full enlightenment should from t
he very beginning tend, love and honour the good friends.Subhuti: Who are those good friends of a Bodhisattva? The Lord:
The Buddhas and Lords, and also the irreversible Bodhisattvas who are skilful in the Bodhisattva-course, and who instru
ct and admonish him in the perfections, who demonstrate and expound the perfection of wisdom.The perfection of wisdom in
particular should be regarded as a Bodhisattva’s good friend.All the six perfections, in fact, are the good friends of 
a Bodhisattva.They are his Teacher, his path, his light, his torch, his illumination, his shelter, his refuge, his place
of rest, his final relief, (397) his island, his mother, his father, and they lead him to cognition, to understanding, 
to full enlightenment.For it is in these perfections that the perfection of wisdom is accomplished.Simply from the six p
erfections has come forth the all-knowledge of the Tathagatas who, in the past period, have won full enlightenment and t
hen entered Nirvana.And so has the all-knowledge of the Tathagatas who in a future period will win enlightenment,and of 
the Tathagatas who just now reside in incalculable, immeasurable, infinite, inconceivable world systems.I also, Subhuti,
am a Tathagata who has in this present period won full enlightenment,and my all-knowledge also has come forth from the 
six perfections.For the six perfections contain the thirty-seven dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment, they conta
in the four Brahma-dwellings, the four means of conversion,and any Buddha-dharma there may be, any Buddha-cognition, cog
nition of the Self-Existent, any unthinkable, incomparable, immeasurable, incalculable, unequalled cognition, any cognit
ion which equals the unequalled, any cognition of the all-knowing.Therefore, Subhuti, simply the six perfections of a Bo
dhisattva (398) should be known as his good friends. They are his Teacher, etc., to: they lead him to cognition, to unde
rstanding, to full enlightenment.In addition, a Bodhisattva who trains in the six perfections becomes a true benefactor 
to all beings who are in need of one.

But if he wants to train in the six perfections, a Bodhisattva must above all hear this perfection of wisdom, take it up,
bear it in mind, recite, study, spread, demonstrate, expound, explain and write it, and investigate its meaning, conten
t and method, meditate on it, and ask questions about it.For this perfection of wisdom directs the six perfections, guid
es, leads, instructs and advises them, is their genetrix and nurse.Because, if they are deprived of the perfection of wi
sdom, the first five perfections do not come under the concept of perfections, and they do not deserve to be called ‘per
fections.’A Bodhisattva should therefore train in just this perfection of wisdom if he wishes to get to a state where he
cannot be led astray by others, and to stand firmly in it.
