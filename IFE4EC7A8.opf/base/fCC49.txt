2. How the Tathagata knows the worldSubhuti: How does perfect wisdom instruct the Tathagatas in this world, and what is i
t that the Tathagatas call ‘world’? (256) The Lord: The five skandhas have by the Tathagata have declared as ‘world’ [lo
ka].Which five? Form, feeling, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness.

Subhuti: How have the five skandhas been shown up by the perfection of wisdom of the Tathagatas, or what has been shown u
p by her? The Lord: The perfect wisdom of the Tathagatas has pointed out the five skandhas as ‘the world’ [loka], becaus
e they do not crumble, nor crumble away [lujyante, pralujyante].For the five skandhas have emptiness for own-being, and,
as devoid of own-being, emptiness cannot crumble nor crumble away.It is in this sense that perfect wisdom instructs the
Tathagatas in this world.And as emptiness does not crumble, nor crumble away, so also the Signless, the Wishless, the U
neffected, the Unproduced, Non-existence, and the Realm of Dharma.
